# isisbusinesstest 

Apache ISIS repository using 1.10.0-SNAPSHOT

I found that the Tenancy autoComplete is not showing any options,
when I try to select a Tenancy, it always says "no matches found".

Also, every page you open issues the error "boolint found errors in
this document, see the Javascript console for details". I guess those
might be issues getting solved in the 1.10.0-SNAPSHOT.
